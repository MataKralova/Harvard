1.  <stdint.h> is a header file that contains the definitions of fixed-width integer types.
2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t and uint16_t are data types also known as BYTE, DWORD, LONG and WORD respectively 
    and they are essential construction elements of any BMP file.
3.  BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes and WORD is 2 bytes long.
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file are called Header Field and must be 0x42 0x4D, which is equivalent to BM in ASCII.
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole BMP file, while biSize is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER of the given BMP file.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and it's origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  Intensity of colour is specified in biBitCount field.
8.  fopen might return NULL if the file doesn't exist, or if it's not located in the working directory, for example.
9.  The third argument of fread is always 1, because we want to iterate over one triple at a time.
10. The value assigned to padding in line 65 is 3.
11. fseek seeks the current position of the cursor (file position indicator) in a BMP file.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the cursor (file position indicator) in a BMP file.
