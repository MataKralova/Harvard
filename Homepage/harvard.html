        <div class="container">
            <h3 style="text-align: justify">Studying at Harvard has been my dream since I was a teenager and when CS50 staff gave us the option to attend in person,
            I was thrilled. And when my sister heard about it, she said: "You're going to Harvard??? I wanna go, too! I wanna go,
            too!" So we booked our flights for October 2018 and spent 11 unforgettable days in Boston and Cambridge.</h3>

                First morning on the US soil, taking a selfie in the Sanders Theatre and not believing this is really happening...
                Professor Malan appears onstage... CS50 lecture is about to start... excitement level 9000!
